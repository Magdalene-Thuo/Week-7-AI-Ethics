Part 4: Ethical Reflection 
Reflection on a Personal Project

In my upcoming project on training AI chatbots for education access in rural Kenya, I will ensure ethical adherence by:

Data Privacy: Collect only necessary data and ensure itâ€™s anonymized.

Transparency: Clearly communicate how the bot works to users.

Bias Mitigation: Train on inclusive data representing diverse dialects and education levels.

Human Oversight: Ensure educators can override or explain bot suggestions.
